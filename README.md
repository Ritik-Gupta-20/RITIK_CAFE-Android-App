# RITIK_CAFE-Android-App
A MULTI-SCREEN Cafeteria App for University and School level.

**Working**

This is how it works: 

All Employees/Students are given apps, which they can access either on their mobiles or computers, view the list of service providers, scan through the provided menus, order the food, mention the time of pick-up and pay for it. All of that is happening outside the cafeteria, thus reducing the waiting time.

The food vendor knows when the food has to be got ready and the employee can go to the counter at the specified time, authenticate his or her order and gets it..

While waiting for your order, one can play a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in his/her free time.
With the funny comments side by side.
